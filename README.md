# Rails API Starter App

This is a skeleton Ruby on Rails App in API mode with some frequently used configuration. Each branch contains a different set of addons we're frequently using.

## USAGE

Clone down the repo and checkout the master branch. Merge in each branch you are interested in using. (Devise users, etc.). Rename the app, the databases, and this branch becomes the master of your new repo.
